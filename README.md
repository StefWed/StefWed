## About me

I am an economist passionate about data, sharing some of my data analysis/ Data Science projects. 
I recently attended an intensive course at <a href='https://academy.constructor.org/de'>Constructor Academy<a> through which I gained profound knowledge in key Data Science concepts and technologies (Machine/Deep Learning, NLP, Visualization, SQL).


- ðŸ”­  Iâ€™m currently working on revising finished projects for GitHub. For the time being, have a look at my first side project on how I leveraged web scraping for my second hobby - patchwork and quilting - 
<a href='https://github.com/StefWed/quilted_web_scraper'>Using Web Scraping for Your Hobby<a>. Also, my project on how to scrape data from social platforms and investigating them to get insights on public opinion, market trends and more is growing - <a href='https://github.com/StefWed/investigate-public-opinion-on-retail'>Investigate Public Opinion about Retail Trade on Mastodon<a>.

- ðŸ“š  These days, I am reading "Economics: The user's guide", as well as some chapters of "Hands-On Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn, Keras & TensorFlow" and "An Introduction to Statistical Learning".

- ðŸ“«  How to reach me: write me a message on LinkedIn!

- âš¡  Fun fact: I love running half marathons because it's a great way to explore lots of different cities or pretty landscapes.
